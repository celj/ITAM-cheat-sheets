## General equilibrium

### Pure exchange economies {-}

#### Initial assumptions {-}

* There are $m$ consumers such that $\mathcal{I} = \{1, \dots, m\}$.
* There are $n$ goods such that $\L = \{1, \dots, n\}$.
* A utility function $u_i : \R^\L \to \R$ represents the preferences of the $i$th consumer.
* Each consumer can consume goods in $\mathrm{x}_i \in \R^\L_+$.
* Each consumer has an initial endowment of $\mathrm{w}_i \in \R^\L_+$.
* The ordered pair $(u_i, \mathrm{w}_i)$ describes each consumer.
* The utility functions represent neoclassical preferences.

::: {.proposition}
If $\mathrm{x} \succ_i \mathrm{y}$, then $u_i(\mathrm{x}) > u_i(\mathrm{y})$.
:::

::: {.definition name="Exchange economy"}
A *pure exchange economy* is
$$
\mathcal{E} = \left\langle \mathcal{I}, (u_i, \mathrm{w}_i)_{i\in\mathcal{I}} \right\rangle,
$$
where $\mathcal{I}$ is the set of agents; $u_i$ and $\mathrm{w}_i$ are the utility function and initial endowment of the $i$th consumer, respectively.
:::

::: {.definition name="Total endowment"}
$$
\Omega = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} \mathrm{w}_i.
$$
:::

::: {.definition name="Resource allocation"}
The *resource allocation* is denoted by $X = (\mathrm{x}_1, \mathrm{x}_2, \dots, \mathrm{x}_m)$, where $\mathrm{x}_i \in \R^\L_+$.
:::

::: {.definition name="Feasible allocation"}
The *feasible allocation* $\F$ of an economy $\mathcal{E}$ is defined by
$$
\F = \left\{ X = (\mathrm{x}_1, \mathrm{x}_2, \dots, \mathrm{x}_m)\ :\ \mathrm{x}_i \in \R^\L_i,\ \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} \mathrm{x}_i = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} \mathrm{w}_i \right\}.
$$
:::

::: {.definition name="Pareto efficiency"}
Let $\mathcal{E}$ be an exchange economy. A feasible allocation of resources $X$ is said to be *Pareto efficient* if and only if there is no other feasible allocation $\hat{X}$ such that, for every agent in $\mathcal{I}$, $u_i(\hat{\mathrm{x}}_i) \geq u_i(\mathrm{x}_i)$ and, for at least one agent $j$, $u_j(\hat{\mathrm{x}}_j) > u_j(\mathrm{x}_j)$.
:::

::: {.definition name="Pareto dominance"}
Let $X$ and $\hat{X}$ be two feasible allocations. We say that $\hat{X}$ *Pareto dominates* $X$ if and only if
$$
u_i(\hat{x}_{i,1}, \dots, \hat{x}_{i,n}) \geq u_i(x_{i,1}, \dots, x_{i,n}), \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{I},
$$
and there is at least one consumer $j$ such that
$$
u_j(\hat{x}_{j,1}, \dots, \hat{x}_{j,n}) > u_i(x_{j,1}, \dots, x_{j,n}).
$$
:::

::: {.definition name="Contract curve"}
The set of all Pareto allocations is known as the *contract curve*.

#### General case {-}

\begin{align*}
\max_{\{ \mathrm{x}_1,\ \dots\ ,\ \mathrm{x}_m \}} \quad & u_1(x_{1,1}, \dots, x_{1,n}) \\
\text{subject to} \quad & u_2(x_{2,1}, \dots, x_{2,n}) \geq \bar{u}_2, \\
& \quad \vdots \\
& u_m(x_{m,1}, \dots, x_{m,n}) \geq \bar{u}_m; \\
& \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} x_{i,1} \leq w_1, \\
& \quad \vdots \\
& \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} x_{i,n} \leq w_n.
\end{align*}

::: {.theorem}
Let all utility functions be strictly increasing and quasiconcave, and $\hat{X}$ be a feasible interior allocation. Then $\hat{X}$ is *Pareto efficient* if and only if $\hat{X}$ exhausts all resources and, for all pairs of goods $(\ell, \ell')$,
$$
\MRS(\ell, \ell')(\hat{x}_{1,1}, \dots, \hat{x}_{1,n}) = \cdots = \MRS(\ell, \ell')(\hat{x}_{m,1}, \dots, \hat{x}_{m,n}).
$$
:::

### Competitive equilibrium {-}

#### Initial assumptions {-}

* There is a market for each good.
* Every agent can access the market without any cost.
* There is a single price for each good.
* All consumers know the price.
* Each consumer can sell their initial endowment in the market and use the income to buy goods and services.
* Consumers seek to maximize their utility given their budget restriction, independently of what everyone else is doing.
* There is no centralized mechanism.
* People may not know othersâ€™ preferences or endowments.
* There is perfect competition (namely, everyone is a price-taker).
* Prices are the only source of information for agents.

::: {.definition name="Competitive equilibrium"}
An ordered pair of an allocation and a price vector, $\left( X^*, \mathrm{p} = (p_1, \dots, p_n) \right)$, is called a *competitive equilibrium* if the following conditions hold:

1. $\forall i \in \mathcal{I}$, $\mathrm{x}_i^* = (x_{i,1}^*, \dots, x_{i,n}^*)$ solves the following maximization problem:
\begin{align*}
\max_{\{ \mathrm{x}_i \}} \quad & u_i(\mathrm{x}_i) \\
\text{subject to} \quad & wh + \langle \mathrm{p}, \mathrm{x}_i \rangle \leq \langle \mathrm{p}, \mathrm{w}_i \rangle = \sum_{\ell \in \L} p_{\ell} w_{i,\ell}.
\end{align*}
2. Markets clear, i.e. $\displaystyle \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} x_{i,\ell}^* = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} w_{i,\ell}$, $\forall \ell \in \L$.
:::

::: {.proposition}
Given at least one consumer with strictly monotonic preferences. Then, if $(X^*, \mathrm{p})$ is a competitive equilibrium, $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n >0$.
:::

::: {.proposition}
Given at least one consumer with weakly monotonic preferences. Then, if $(X^*, \mathrm{p})$ is a competitive equilibrium, for at least one $\ell$, $p_\ell > 0$.
:::

::: {.proposition}
Let $(X^*, \mathrm{p})$ be a competitive equilibrium. Then, $(X^*, c\mathrm{p})$ is also a competitive equilibrium, $\forall c \in \R_+$.
:::

::: {.theorem name="Walras's Law"}
If the consumer $i$ has weakly monotonic preferences and $\hat{\mathrm{x}}_i \in \mathrm{x}_i^*(\mathrm{p})$, then
$$
\langle \mathrm{p}, \hat{\mathrm{x}}_i \rangle = \sum_{\ell \in \L} p_{\ell} \hat{x}_{i,\ell} = \sum_{\ell \in \L} p_{\ell} w_{i,\ell} = \langle \mathrm{p}, \mathrm{w}_i \rangle.
$$
:::

::: {.corollary name="Walras's Law"}
Given weakly monotonic utility functions and $\mathrm{p} = (p_1, \dots, p_n)$ such that $p_\ell > 0$. If any $(X^*, \mathrm{p})$ in which maximization condition holds, $\forall i \in \mathcal{I}$, and markets clear $\forall \ell = 1, 2, \dots, n - 1$; then, the market clearing condition holds for commodity $n$ as well.
